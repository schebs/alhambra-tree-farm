# Our Trees

## Pre-Cut Trees

Our premium pre-cut trees are sourced from Oregon and Washington and include varieties like Noble Fir and Silvertip. Each tree is given a fresh cut upon arrival and placed in water to maintain peak freshness. Before you take one home, we’ll give it another fresh cut so it lasts all season long.

## U-Cut Trees

Our U-Cut field includes Monterey Pines, Douglas Firs, Sequoias, and Cedars. Grown and hand-trimmed with care, our trees are ready for you to cut with help from our team. We’ll provide saws, carts, and smiles.
