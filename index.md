# Welcome to Alhambra Valley Christmas Tree Farm

For over 55 years, Alhambra Valley Christmas Tree Farm has proudly provided the Bay Area with top-quality Christmas trees, wreaths, and garland.

## About Us

We're a family-run farm — Mark, Bea, and their children Wyatt and Ellie have been tending trees for over a decade. We love supporting our local community by hiring high school and college students, and we're proud to share this special place with everyone who visits.
