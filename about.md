# Our Story

In 2014, our family stumbled upon this scenic ranch and instantly felt at home. Drawn in by its charm and history, we took on the opportunity to preserve the legacy of the historic Griffin farm — dating back to 1868 and once visited by John Muir.

With care and commitment, we’ve grown a vibrant selection of U-Cut and Pre-Cut trees that bring joy to homes each holiday season. We cherish the moments spent among our trees and with the community that supports us.

We hope your family will visit and start or continue a tradition with us. Whether you come for the perfect tree or just to soak in the holiday spirit, we’re here to welcome you with open arms.

— Mark, Bea, Wyatt & Ellie
